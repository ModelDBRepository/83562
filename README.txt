This is the (top-level) README.txt for the model code associated with
the publications:

Humphries, M. D. & Gurney, K. N. (2002). The role of intra-thalamic
and thalamocortical circuits in action selection. Network: Computation
in Neural Systems, 13, 131-156.

Humphries, M.D. (2003). High level modeling of dopamine mechanisms in
 striatal neurons. Technical Report ABRG 3. Dept. Psychology
 University of Sheffield, UK.  Simulink model of the extended basal
 ganglia model

There is both a MATLAB version (see README_matlab.txt) and a simulink
version (see README_simulink.txt) of the extended basal ganglia model.
